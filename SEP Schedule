## Reading the CHI Research Paper and Understanding the Project:

I want you guys to create a summary by the end of the week to highlight the overview, methodology, weaknesses, and strengths.

## Building Fundamentals with Python:

In this week, you guys will be programming a simple Library Management System with classes such as Books, Members, and Library. These classes would have methods:
- `update()`
- `borrow_book()`
- `return_book()`
- `get_borrowed_books()`
- `add_book()`
- `remove_book()`
- `search_book()`
- `add_member()`
- `remove_member()`
- `search_member()`
- `borrow_book()`
- `return_book()`
- `check_overdue_books()`
- `display_all_books()`
- `display_all_members()`

This project will give you a good foundation in object-oriented programming.

## Understanding PyGame with a Simple Snake Project:

In this week, you will be programming a snake game with the help of PyGame. The objective here is to make you comfortable working with PyGame.

## Research Specific Tasks - P3:

- Data analysis and Data Cleaning
- Clustering and Unsupervised Machine Learning
- Visualizations using PyGame and matplotlib
- Data Filtering

## Research Specific Tasks - P4:

- Data analysis and Data Cleaning on clusters
- Designing Fuzz Probe combinations
- Designing Fault Trees and minimal logic functions
- Visualization of fault tree using PyGame

## Research Specific Tasks - P5:

- Learn about Microservice architectures
- Learn about MQTT through a simple project
- Implement a handshake microservice (on-entry) that talks through the MQTT protocol to retrieve data from a system
- Implement a similar handshake (on-exit) that talks through the MQTT protocol to update the system with new data

## Poster Presentation Preparation:

This week will be dedicated to preparing for the poster presentation on July 24th.
